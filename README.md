# Image-ClassificationAssignment


This is the Data Career Boot Camp Final Project, We are giving Certificates to all those who are able to complete the Project Track successfully using DVC.
How can object detection and classification techniques based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) be used to automatically identify and classify animals in images using the Animals Detection Images Dataset?
Build an animal detection model and deploy your model using flask:
